### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Description of the structure/architecture of the application:

1. To make the app as fast as possible I used the `antd` component library.
2. At a structural point of view I made folders indicating where each element of the app is.
3. Made the app responsive by using the media queries and antd props.
4. Implemented Redux
5. Implemented a server
